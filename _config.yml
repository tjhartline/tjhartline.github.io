This Github Page will explain my experiences and lessons learned while earning my Bachelor's of Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics at SNHU.
  <br><br>
I will also briefly discuss what I was able to learn during my time as an SNHU Data Reporting Coordinator as a student worker, a software engineering leadership intern during the Girls Who Code Fall Leadership Academy Hosted by Raytheon(RTX), 
and my current Project Management role at Scale AI.
