# Tammy Hartline's Computer Science E-Portfolio

### Welcome to my Github Pages E-Portfolio! (✿◠‿◠)

This Portfolio demonstrates my mastery and gained knowledge having completed all required courses to earn my Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics from SNHU, which will be official in approximately one week (March 4, 2024). It represents a small, yet comprehensive sample of my experiences and skills gained during my time in pursuit of this degree. This e-Portfolio was designed, developed, and deployed with great care and time to demonstrate a reviewable, readable, comprehensive, and professional visual that will highlight a wide array of technical proficiencies.
