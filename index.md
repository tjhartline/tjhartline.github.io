# Tammy Hartline's Computer Science E-Portfolio

Hello, my name is Tammy Hartline and I would like to welcome you to my Github Pages E-Portfolio! (✿◠‿◠)

# About My Portfolio

This Portfolio demonstrates my mastery and gained knowledge having completed all required courses to earn my Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics from SNHU, which will be official in approximately one week (March 4, 2024). It represents a small, yet comprehensive sample of my experiences and skills gained during my time in pursuit of this degree. I designed, developed, and deployed this portfolio with great care and time to present an interactive, readable, comprehensive, and professional project and webpage that will highlight a wide array of technical proficiencies that will enable me to succeed in any role I pursue in the computer science field.

# About Me

I am a mother to three amazing daughters, wife to my wonderful husband for 20 years, and have over a decade of previous expertise in Business Administration, Banking and Finances, and US tax preparation. We enjoy our mountain home that is perched on the bluff in Northeast Alabama. My passion has always been more related to creative activities, and athletics. I have also coached competitive cheer and gymnastics since I was 14 years old, and continue to do so, after discovering my love for the sport in high school, and winning the 2004 High School Cheerleading National Championship with my cheer squad my senior year. I have since coached young cheerleaders ages 12 - 22, and have over 40 that went on to compete at the national level in both high school and collegiate levels, which includes several that also brought home a National Championship title.

# Career - Past

While my career may have started in a non-tech related field, I always enjoyed taking things apart, discovering how things worked, and had a passion for computers and software. 

Following a Narcolepsy with Cataplexy diagnosis in 2009, I needed to reaccess my ability to work, and was limited to positions that offered flexible schedules, or seasonal work. However, when COVID-19 hit the USA, it forever changed the way most of us viewed remote work. During this time, I decided to take a chance to pursue a degree in a field I was passionate about, but never took the initiative to study, as it was "outside of the norms", for a woman, particularly in the south to take on a role in a technology related field. 

Fast forward two years, and here we are in 2024, as I am working to complete my final two courses needed for my BS in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics, graduating in the top of my glass, with a perfect 4.0 GPA to date. I have also gained invaluable work experience, as I worked remotely for the past two years as a student worker for SNHU in the Analytics Department as a Data Reporting Coordinator, Data Mapping SME, Project Manager, Business Intelligence Data Analyst, Systems Query Developer and Report Developer. I also worked as an Interning Software Engineer during the Fall 2023 Season via the Girls Who Code Leadership Academy, which was hosted by Raytheon Technologies (RTX). 

# Career - Present

The final week of November I completed my internship and with graduation nearing, had been actively searching for my next opportunity. Following my very first technical interview for a Technical Team Lead Position, the interviewer told me he wasn't saying no, but he also wasn't saying yes, as he thought I lacked proficiency in the technical side of the job regarding usage of Python and Java. After the interview ended I couldn't help but feel a little defeated, as I had never not been told yes following a 1:1 interview. 

The following day, I sent him a follow-up message, conveying my gratitude for taking the time to interview me, but also letting them know I was the right person for the position. After reading through my pitch, I was then given a chance in the position. February 22, 2024 marked my 90th day in the role with the San Francisco California Scale AI office. 

Then, on February 24, 2024, I was promoted to Team Lead Coordinator, which is where I am now in my career path. I am extremely happy in my current role, and have no intentions of slowing down. While early in my degree path I was determined to go any direction other than STEM Project Management, it is indeed what I excel at. I do still get to work on development projects, but most of my focus is on Leadership in the technical field. 

# Career - Future

While I am striving currently as a Coordinator with a very large AI tech company, I would like to work my toward being more on the AI development side, as I tend to be passionate about AI, Data, and puzzle solving, which is out of scope in my current position. I plan to continue to hone my skills related to LLM's, algorithms, and training sets. My ultimate goal, is to advance and settle into the role of a Prompt Engineer here at my current company.
